        <p class="lead mb-4">Born and raised in Oakland, California I grew up in a very hardworking family that came to America for a better life. Shortly after living in Oakland for a few years I continued my life in San Leandro. In San Leandro I was able to acquire several different jobs and tasks throughout my time spent there. 
My first experience is with the usage of technology. Creating videos for First United Credit Union‚Äôs kick off meetings as well as also joining Interact as their Co-Digital Media Coordinator. With this position I was required to create flyers for events as well as take photos during these events and upload them. 
After my term ended I was able to apply for the District of Interact 5170 as their Co-Digital Media Coordinator the following year. Throughout the position I was responsible for creating videos of events as well as taking pictures. The project I was assigned for was the video of the International Project of the Year that was revealed at the biggest event of the year, Fall Leadership Conference. Throughout this experience I was able to acquire many meaningful memories as well as skills. From networking at different meetings with rotarians to other members of Interact it was an opportunity of a lifetime that I was able to experience. With not only the main goal of being service oriented but also helping one another out. 
<br><br>

        Throughout my Interact history I was able to attend overnight stays that helped build my confidence in working with others. An example of this is the RYLA, throughout RYLA I was able to not only meet new people but also go through a workshop to help me better my skills in digital media. With the people I was teamed up with we were able to create a video of our time at RYLA called ‚ÄúThrough our eyes‚Äù which was presented to everyone towards the end of the week. 
<br><br>

        Another overnight stay I was able to attend was UC Berkeley's Rotaract event. This was my very first overnight stay event for Interact. Through this event the main focus was community service. During our stay we were able to help package medical packages for third world and underprivileged areas. However, that was not all that it was. I was also able to go through workshops that helped build my skills in planning, and self care. Through these workshops I was able to dive deeper into my future and take into more consideration of what I want to learn as well as what values I want to set for myself as I continue my journey.
In my senior year of high school I also was a tutor afterschool at a place called Ace, located in a small plaza. During this time I was able to help guide students through their homework. From math assignments to English papers I helped to make sure that the students were able to understand the steps needed to complete the task. Through this job I was able to build my confidence in helping people of all ages with a bigger range of communication skills.
